Below is a detailed two‑week roadmap for building **Relay Hook** on Uniswap v4, broken down by day and task:

---

### **Week 1: Research, Setup, and Initial Development**

**Day 1: Requirements & Research**  
- Define the project scope and objectives (i.e. reducing gas fees via an on‑chain relayer hook).  
- Review Uniswap v4 documentation, the provided blog on building hooks (e.g. PointsHook), and related resources.  
- Identify key integration points (before/after swap, liquidity actions) for your relay logic.

# Done

**Day 2: Environment Setup**  
- Clone the Uniswap v4‑template repository and set up the Foundry environment.  
- Install dependencies and run initial tests to confirm the baseline environment.  
- Set up version control and a project management tool to track progress.

# Done

**Day 3: Architecture & Design**  
- Sketch out the high‑level architecture for Relay Hook including on‑chain hook structure, off‑chain relayer interaction, and gas optimization logic.  
- Decide which hooks (e.g. beforeSwap/afterSwap) will be used for relayer integration.  
- Draft a technical design document outlining interfaces, security checks, and data flow.

# Done

**Day 4: Basic Hook Contract Implementation**  
- Create a new Solidity contract (e.g. RelayHook.sol) based on the PointsHook template.  
- Override the required hook functions (afterSwap and afterAddLiquidity) to prepare for relay logic integration.  
- Add placeholder functions for relayer integration and gas optimization logic.

# Done

**Day 5: Integrate Off‑Chain Relayer Logic (Part 1)**  
- Begin implementing the basic off‑chain relayer interface within the hook contract.  
- Develop helper functions for encoding/decoding hook data (e.g. user addresses).  
- Establish a simple relay condition (e.g. “if conditions met, forward swap details”) in the hook functions.

# Done

**Day 6: Contract Testing – Part 1**  
- Write unit tests for the basic hook functionality using Foundry.  
- Test initial cases for swap and liquidity actions without the full relay logic.  
- Ensure the contract returns correct selectors and placeholder values.

# Done

**Day 7: Code Review & Refinement**  
- Review the implemented code with a focus on compliance with Uniswap v4’s hook requirements.  
- Refine the hook permissions and initial logic.  
- Document the code with comments and update your design document as needed.

# Done

### **Week 2: Advanced Functionality, Testing, and Deployment**

**Day 8: Integrate Off‑Chain Relayer Logic (Part 2)**  
- Expand the relay logic: implement batching, gas fee optimization, and fallback paths.  
- Integrate external relayer service interfaces (e.g. mimic Gelato Relay behavior) within the hook functions.  
- Handle edge cases and ensure secure validation of relayer responses.

**Day 9: Advanced Testing – Simulating Relay Behavior**  
- Extend your test suite to simulate real‑world scenarios (exact input/output swaps, varying gas conditions).  
- Write tests to confirm that the relay logic triggers under correct conditions.  
- Begin benchmarking gas usage differences with and without relay intervention.

**Day 10: Security Auditing & Optimization**  
- Perform a security audit of the new relay logic: review for potential vulnerabilities (reentrancy, front‑running, etc.).  
- Optimize contract code to minimize gas costs while maintaining clarity and security.  
- Incorporate feedback from internal or peer reviews.

**Day 11: Integration Testing with Uniswap v4**  
- Deploy the Relay Hook contract to a local/testnet environment (e.g. Goerli or Sepolia).  
- Set up a test pool with Uniswap v4 and integrate your hook.  
- Execute end‑to‑end tests for both swap and liquidity addition flows, verifying that relay actions are correctly executed.

**Day 12: Documentation & Developer Guides**  
- Write detailed documentation for the Relay Hook including setup instructions, API interfaces, and integration guides.  
- Prepare a developer guide outlining how to interact with the relay logic, including encoding/decoding hook data.
- Update your technical design document with any changes made during implementation.

**Day 13: Final Refinements & Pre‑Deployment Testing**  
- Address any issues found during integration testing and documentation feedback.  
- Run a final suite of tests, including stress tests, to verify stability under load and edge conditions.  
- Prepare release notes and finalize the versioning of your contract.

**Day 14: Deployment & Post‑Deployment Monitoring**  
- Deploy the final Relay Hook contract to a mainnet test environment.  
- Set up monitoring and logging to track real‑world performance and gas optimization metrics.  
- Plan for post‑deployment support, including potential bug fixes and further optimizations based on user feedback.

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing Relay Hook over a two‑week period, ensuring that each phase—from initial research to deployment—is thoroughly planned and executed.
